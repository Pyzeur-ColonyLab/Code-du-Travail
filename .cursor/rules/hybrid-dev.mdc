# Hybrid Development Rule

## Environment Priority
- **Always consider the instance environment** as the primary development environment
- Treat local environment as secondary/supporting environment
- All development decisions should prioritize instance compatibility

## Development Guidelines
- When making code changes, consider how they will work on the instance
- Use instance-specific configurations and paths when applicable
- Test and validate changes against instance environment requirements
- Consider instance limitations and constraints in development decisions

## File and Path Considerations
- Use relative paths that work on both local and instance
- Consider instance file system structure and permissions
- Account for instance-specific environment variables and configurations

## Deployment and Testing
- Prioritize instance deployment workflows
- Test functionality in instance-like environments
- Consider instance performance and resource constraints
